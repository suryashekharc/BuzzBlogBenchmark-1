# Tutorial
This tutorial shows how to run a *BuzzBlog Benchmark* experiment.

If you are a Georgia Tech student enrolled in *Introduction to Enterprise
Computing* (CS4365/6365) or *Real-Time/Embedded Systems* (CS4220/CS6235), read
the [tutorial on how to setup a CloudLab account](CLOUDLAB.md) first.

## Cloud Instantiation
1. Access the [CloudLab login page](https://cloudlab.us/login.php) and sign in.
2. In the main menu, click on
[Start Experiment](https://www.cloudlab.us/instantiate.php).
3. Click on *Change Profile*.
4. Search for profile *BuzzBlog-19_xl170_nodes* of project *Infosphere*. This
profile specifies a cloud with 19 xl170 machines (x86 architecture) running a
patched version of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) 64-bit. Click on *Select Profile*.
5. Optionally, you can give a name to your experiment. Click on *Next*.
6. Optionally, you can set a start time and duration for your experiment. The
default duration is 16 hours, but you will need much less time (3 hours should
be enough).
7. Click on *Finish*.

Your cloud will be ready in approximately 30 minutes, if the nodes requested are
available.

## Controller Setup
The experiment workflow is executed by the `controller`, a containerized
application that installs software dependencies, starts services and monitors,
runs workload generators, and collects log files.

To prepare `node-0` for running `controller`:
1. Download `scripts/controller_setup.sh` in your local machine.
2. Run the script:
```
./controller_setup.sh \
    --username [your cloudlab username] \
    --private_ssh_key_path [path to your private ssh key] \
    --controller_node [node-0 hostname]
```

`controller_setup.sh` will copy your SSH private key to `node-0` so the
`controller` can connect to other nodes. This SSH private key must be the one
associated with the SSH public key that you uploaded to CloudLab when creating
your account. For security reasons, use this pair of SSH keys for your CloudLab
experiments only. This script will also install software dependencies of
`controller`.

## SSH Server Setup
The `controller` is a multithreaded application whose threads share SSH
connections to run commands in remote nodes in parallel.

To increase the maximum number of sessions allowed per SSH connection in every
node:
1. Download `scripts/sshd_setup.sh` in your local machine.
2. Run the script:
```
./sshd_setup.sh \
    --username [your cloudlab username] \
    --controller_node [node-0 hostname] \
    --n_nodes 19
```

## Log Storage Setup
The application and monitoring log files are stored in the `/tmp` directory. For
high workloads, the size of log files can be in the order of gigabytes.

To setup and mount a large disk partition on `/tmp` in every node:
1. Download `scripts/tmp_directory_setup.sh` in your local machine.
2. Run the script:
```
./tmp_directory_setup.sh \
    --username [your cloudlab username] \
    --controller_node [node-0 hostname] \
    --n_nodes 19 \
    --partition /dev/sda4
```

## Experiment Configuration
To generate the experiment configuration files in `node-0`:
1. Download `scripts/tutorial_configuration_setup.sh` in your local machine.
2. Run the script:
```
./tutorial_configuration_setup.sh \
    --username [your cloudlab username] \
    --controller_node [node-0 hostname] \
    --system_template BuzzBlog-19_xl170_nodes.yml \
    --workload_template BuzzBlog-bursty_workload.yml
```

Log into `node-0`:
```
ssh [your cloudlab username]@[node-0 hostname]
```

In the home folder, you will find experiment configuration files `system.yml`
and `workload.yml`.

`system.yml` contains the system configuration of each node: kernel parameters
to be overwritten, containers to be deployed and their options, system
monitoring options, etc. For a better understanding of your experiment, read
this file and how it is used by `controller` (specifically, in the Python script
`controller/src/run_experiment.py`).

`workload.yml` contains the workload configuration: number of clients, mean
think time, burstiness options, and probabilities of transitioning between
request types. For a better understanding of your experiment, read this file and
how it is used by `loadgen` to generate requests simulating user interactions
with BuzzBlog (specifically, in the Python script `loadgen/loadgen.py`).

## Experiment Execution
Still in `node-0`, run command:
```
sudo docker run \
    --name benchmarkcontroller \
    --env description="My first BuzzBlog experiment." \
    --env docker_hub_username="" \
    --env docker_hub_password="" \
    --volume $(pwd):/usr/local/etc/BuzzBlogBenchmark \
    --volume /tmp:/var/log/BuzzBlogBenchmark \
    --volume $(pwd)/.ssh:/home/$(whoami)/.ssh \
    $(echo $(cat /etc/hosts | grep node- | sed 's/[[:space:]]/ /g' | cut -d ' ' -f 1,4 | sed 's:^\(.*\) \(.*\):\2\:\1:' | awk '{print "--add-host="$1""}')) \
    rodrigoalveslima/buzzblog:benchmarkcontroller_v1.0
```

If you want to run multiple experiments:
1. Add system and workload configuration files to directories named `system` and
`workload` in the home folder.
2. Use the following options when running the `controller` container:
`--env workload_conf="/usr/local/etc/BuzzBlogBenchmark/workload"` and
`--env system_conf="/usr/local/etc/BuzzBlogBenchmark/system"`.

A single experiment will take approximately 30 minutes to finish, and its
results will be in a directory named `BuzzBlogBenchmark_[%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S]` in
the `/tmp` directory.

After the experiment is finished, compress that directory:
```
cd /tmp
tar -czf $(ls . | grep BuzzBlogBenchmark_).tar.gz BuzzBlogBenchmark_*/*
```

And save the experiment results in your local machine:
```
scp [your cloudlab username]@[node-0 hostname]:/tmp/BuzzBlogBenchmark_*.tar.gz .
```

Finally, terminate the CloudLab experiment.

## Data Analysis
In directory `analysis`, you can find scripts and Jupyter notebooks to assist
the analysis of experiment results.
